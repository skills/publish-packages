## Step 4: Pull your image

_Now things are running! :sparkles:_

Whoa, now things are running! This may take a few minutes. This might take a tiny amount of time, so grab your popcorn :popcorn: and wait for the build to finish before moving on.

To pull the Docker image, we need to log into Docker first.

Before we can use this Docker image, you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) that contains the following permissions:

- repo (all)
- write:packages
- read:packages

![screenshot personal access token creation page with boxes for repo (all), write:packages, and read:packages checked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3250463/219254714-82bb1da5-33b1-491b-97c0-b25f51494f6a.png)

We will use this token to log in to Docker, and authenticate with the package.

1. Open your terminal (Bash or Git Bash recommended).
1. Use the following command to log in:
   ```bash
   docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME
   ```
1. Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
1. Enter your new Personal Access Token as the password.
1. Press **Enter**.

If everything went well, :crossed_fingers: you should see `Login Succeeded` in your terminal.

### :keyboard: Activity: Pull your image

1. Copy and paste the `pull` command from the package instructions into your terminal. It should look something like this:
   - `docker pull ghcr.io/YOURNAME/publish-packages/game:TAG`

   - _Tip: To reach this page, click the **Code** tab at the top of your repository. Then, find the navigation bar below the repository description, and click the **Packages** heading link_
1. Replace `YOURNAME` with your GitHub username.
1. Replace `TAG` with the image tag.
1. Press **Enter**.
1. You should see output indicating that the pull was successful, like `Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/YOURNAME/publish-packages/game:TAG`.
