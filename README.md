# GitHub Actions: Publish to GitHub Packages

_This course will walk you through using GitHub Actions to get your code in a deployable state once your CI workflows have completed._

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Start of the course >>>
  Include start button, a note about actions minutes,
  and tell the learner why they should take the course.
  Each step should be wrapped in <details>/<summary>, with an `id` set.
  The start <details> should have `open` as well.
  Do not use quotes on the <details> tag attributes.

**To start this course: [<img width="150" alt="Use this template" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/148581131-555c0fb8-5361-4450-a760-75fa6219a2fc.png">](https://github.com/githublearn/publish-packages/generate)**

> We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).<br>
> After you make your own repository, wait about 20 seconds and refresh. I will go to the next step.

GitHub Actions makes it easier than ever to incorporate continuous delivery (CD) into your repositories. This course will teach you what is needed to test and deliver artifacts that are ready for deployment.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps engineers, full stack developers, cloud engineers.
- **What you'll learn**: Continuous delivery, save and access build artifacts, package management, how to publish to GitHub Packages.
- **What you'll build**: We will build a Docker image that runs a small game.
- **Prerequisites**: We recommend you first complete the following courses: [Hello, GitHub Actions](https://github.com/githublearn/hello-github-actions) and [Continuous Integration](https://lab.github.com/githublearn/continuous-integration).
- **How long**: This course is 5 steps and takes less than 30 minutes.
